OpenBSD: pf+rdomains create splendid multi-tenancy firewalls
======

Abstract
-----
This talk presents a working OpenBSD environment establishing a multi-tenant
firewall with pf(4), rdomain/pair(4) and relayd(8) as work horses only.

The environment shows how to provision, operate, isolate and manage all the
components needed - and what isn't. It'll reveal how even complex setups can
be developed, tested and provisioned in a straightforward way.

Besides detailing on the OpenBSD bolts, there will be quick walkthrough how
to create testing setups easily using Vagrant in preparation for live usage.

For easy re-enacting all configuration of OpenBSD and Vagrant being used will
be available online.
