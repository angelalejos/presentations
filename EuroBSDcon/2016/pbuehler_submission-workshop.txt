OpenBSD: Building a test-environment for multi-tenancy firewalls (full-day workshop)
======

Abstract
-----
This workshop will be thorough walkthrough on creating a test-environment
for a multi-tenant OpenBSD firewall based on Vagrant VMs.

We will create a base image using packer and multiply that via Vagrant,
including the needed networking to isolate the setup. Following is an
introduction to pf(4) and rdomain(4) and how this is used to create the
multi-tenant firewall. Furthermore it'll be shown how to operate, manage
and extend this for further tenants. Since operations also need measurement
and reporting, there will be some outlook on how to accomplish this.

All configuration of all components being used will be available online. 

Please bring a laptop with Vagrant/1.7.2+, 10GB free disk and 2GB free RAM.
