# Talks/Presentations
All my public presentations

## Dependecies
This relies on https://github.com/double-p/presenter to generate PDFs (in a VM)


## recurring images
Company logo, Puffy and such. Generate the EPS files by
````make img````

## QR generation
http://goqr.me/
EPS downloads seem incompatible/broken for groff/PSPIC, download
as JPG and convert with sam2p.
Replace with some python and py-qrcode?

## URL
curl 'https://v.gd/create.php?format=simple&url=REPO&shorturl=MYSHORT'

## copyright images
All mine/company except the OpenBSD logos, which are from
http://www.openbsd.org/art1.html - please respect the intentions
mentioned there ("dont make a profit").
